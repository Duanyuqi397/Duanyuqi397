## 未来发展规划

I would like to be a QA&development engineer later,and now do some work about function test also is ok

## 做过的项目遇到什么问题，怎么解决

during the weimobcloud template market,We meet a blocking bug the day before launch due to a release failure caused by operations,

At that time, operation and maintenance could not solve this problem in time, so I called the product manager and developers to discuss whether the launch should be postponed

However, the product manager decided that it was still necessary to go online, so I returned to the project while waiting for the operation and maintenance personnel to fix the bug. Fortunately, the problem was solved within the specified time

## 如何保持自我学习

After work, I usually plan my free time, such as a whole day on Saturday to learn new things, and Sunday to do some sports or entertainment is ok
